- Added in basic symbol production
- Added in identifier production

I want to begin testing this I think there's some errors I'm running into and I
don't think these 2 recent productions were written correctly, I want to get to
the point where I can at least output to the console that we've identified the
most abstract production. Next I want to start adding in some components for
code generation in the future, since eventually I will be using llvm for code
generation.
